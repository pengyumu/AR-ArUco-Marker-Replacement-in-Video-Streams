## Registration

The goal is to replace ArUco markers detected in a video with predefined images or patches. Please see below for the steps that were taken during the implementation.

- **Importing Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib are imported for handling video processing and visualization tasks.
  
- **Reading Video and Initializing Parameters**: The `cv2.VideoCapture` function is used to read the input video file (`aruco.mp4`). Video properties like frame rate (fps), width, and height are obtained using `cap.get`. A `VideoWriter` object is initialized to write the processed frames into an output video file (`outputvideo.mp4`) using the MP4V codec.
  
- **Loading ArUco Marker Dictionary and Image Patches**: `cv2.aruco.getPredefinedDictionary` is used to load the predefined dictionary for ArUco markers. Image patches for each ArUco marker ID are loaded into a dictionary.
  
- **Marker Detection and Replacement**: Inside a loop, each frame of the input video is read and processed. The frame is converted to grayscale for marker detection. ArUco markers are detected using `cv2.aruco.detectMarkers`. If markers are detected, replacement images are resized and warped onto the marker positions using homography. The replacement frame is then written into the output video using `out.write`.
  
- **Visualization and Display**: After processing each frame, it is displayed using Matplotlibâ€™s `imshow` function to visualize the replaced markers. A short pause (`cv2.waitKey`) is added to display the frames correctly within the notebook.
  
- **Release Resources**: After processing all frames, resources like `VideoCapture` and `VideoWriter` objects are released using `cap.release()` and `out.release()`.

## Place Virtual Objects

The goal is to replace ArUco markers detected in a video with 3D objects. Please see below for the steps that were taken during the implementation.

- **Initialization**: Libraries `cv2` (OpenCV) and `numpy` are imported to handle image processing and numerical operations. A known physical size of the ArUco marker is defined (`markerlength`), which is crucial for scale consistency in AR. The video file is loaded, and video properties (FPS, width, height) are obtained to initialize the output video parameters.
  
- **Camera Calibration Parameters**: The camera matrix (`cameramatrix`) and distortion coefficients (`distcoeffs`) are defined. These are critical for the accurate placement of 3D objects in the scene. The distortion coefficients are assumed to be zero (no lens distortion). Video properties like frame rate (fps), width, and height are obtained using `cap.get`. A `VideoWriter` object is initialized to write the processed frames into an output video file (`outputvideo.mp4`) using the MP4V codec.
